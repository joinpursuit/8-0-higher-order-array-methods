# Higher Order Native Array Methods Lab

You've been tasked with building functionality for a music application that wants to allow its users to quickly search and sort through their favorite playlists. Use your knowledge of higher order native array methods to solve this functions.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory on your command line. Then, run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the libraries needed to run the tests.

1. Open up the repository in VSCode. Follow the instructions below to complete the Lab.

## Instructions

Complete each function inside of the `src/` folder. The comments and tests will help you determine what each function requires.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run the following command from the command line. You will need to be in the root directory of your repository.

```
npm test
```

This will run the test output once.

#### Test watcher

If you'd like, you can have the tests run constantly. This means that each time you save your file, your tests will re-run. To do so, you can run the following:

```
npm run watch
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to exit out of the constant runner.

### Run test files individually

There are a lot of tests that are contained in this lab. You can run a single test file individually by putting the name of the file after `npm test`. You can even only put part of the file name.

```
npm test 01
```

### Run tests individually

_After choosing a specific file to run,_ you can also specific which test you want to run, specifically. Add `.only` after either `test` or `describe` for the specific test you'd like to run.

```js
test.only("should return an array of everyone's name who is in the line, in order", () => {
```

This will either run the specific `test` or, in the case of adding `.only` to a `describe`, all of the tests for a specific function.

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to remove this after you get the test to pass!

### Run file

If you want to manually test out your file, you can do so by running the following command.

```
node index.js
```

The output will be printed to your terminal.
